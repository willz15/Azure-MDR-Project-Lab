Azure-MDR-Project-Lab
Cloud Security & Threat Hunting Portfolio (2026)
!

Objective
To design, deploy, and secure a hybrid-cloud infrastructure in Microsoft Azure, simulating a corporate environment. This repository serves as a live journal of my journey toward becoming an MDR Analyst, focusing on Identity Governance (IAM), Automated Detection, and AI Security (AISec).

Core Skills Demonstrated
SIEM/SOAR: Microsoft Sentinel (KQL, Analytic Rules, Playbooks).

Identity: Entra ID (Conditional Access, PIM, Governance).

Endpoint: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (EDR) & Servers.

Network: VNet Peering, Azure Firewall, NSGs, and Private Link.

Scripting: PowerShell & Bash for security automation.

Lab Architecture
[!TIP] Insert a diagram here once you complete Month 1!

Environment: Microsoft 365 Developer Tenant (E5 License).

Workloads: Windows 10/11 Endpoints, Ubuntu Server (Linux) VMs.

Monitoring: Log Analytics Workspace (LAW) integrated with Microsoft Sentinel.
